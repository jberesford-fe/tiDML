\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame}

\item{y}{Outcome column}

\item{d}{Treatment column}

\item{x}{Covariate columns}

\item{folds_outer}{Optional rsample rset. If NULL, folds made internally (stratified on D).}

\item{n_folds}{Number of outer folds when \code{folds_outer} is NULL.}

\item{n_rep}{Number of repetitions when \code{folds_outer} is NULL.}

\item{mtry_m}{Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split for the m-model (treatment). Default: floor(p/3).}

\item{mtry_g}{Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split for the g-model (outcome). Default: floor(p/3).}

\item{vcov_type}{Sandwich variance type (e.g., "HC2" or "HC3").}

\item{trees_grid}{Optional grid of number of trees to try (for both m- and g-models).}

\item{store_models}{If TRUE, keep fitted nuisance models inside the result.}
